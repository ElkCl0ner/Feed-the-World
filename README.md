A short game designed for KuriusHacks: CE

Quick note: This is the first time I've uploaded to GitHub and the first short game I have made, so there are most likely a ton of conventions that I have not respected. Please be patient.

Incomplete Parts:
  Character designs
  Tutorial
  Better Endscreen
  Balancing
  Position of minesweeper for all levels
  Sound/Music
  More events (?)
  Credits
  Testing

Known Bugs:
  Holding Mouse1 for too long will trigger on the next scene causing misclick
  Game only saves on Quit Game (Returning to Main Menu and loading game will load previous save only)
    Maybe doesn't save properly at all (?)

Known Exploits:
  Returning to Main Menu during a level and loading the save resets the level and the supplies lost (probably unfixable as fix would lead to bug)
  Returning to Main Menu after loosing some supplies to an event but before ending the level that follows and loading the save resets the event (the supply loss is rng, so the   user can reroll to lose as few supplies as possible)
